## Overview

In my free time, I like to listen to CS lectures (AI related focus) publicly available through Stanford School of Engineering. This repository captures algorithms discussed and implemented in each lecture. Hopefully these can be helpful for anyone interested in self study! (Note: I am not the creator of these algorithms)
