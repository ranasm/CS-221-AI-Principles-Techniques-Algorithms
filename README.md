Coded implementations for algorithms organized by specific class and lecture

In my free time, I like to listen to CS lectures (AI related focus) publicly available through Stanford School of Engineering. This repository captures algorithms discussed and implemented in each lecture. 

Please note that I am not the originator of these algorithms, rather I had liked to compile all algorithms implemented in these lectures into a resource friendly guide so that other interested individuals can be able to easily access such information. 

Sidenote: This is also a great way to learn these algorithms by attempting to code them up myself - recommend for others to do the same!
